In this Program , I have declared three variables i, n & rev inside the main function.
Here ,I have intialized rev with 0.
After then, We would take the input from the user by using scanf function.
And, that input value would get stored in the 'n' variable.
Then, the value of 'n' variable would be copied in the 'i' variable.
After that, Run the while loop to check the condition that number in 'i' variable is not equal to 0.
inside this while loop, we would find the remainder of each digit from right to left.
After continuing the whole process, Now we would get a reverse number.
Now will use 'if' conditon to check the reverse number 'rev' is equal to the Original Number 'n', if the condition beccomes True.
then, will print the output "It is a Palindrome Number" Or if it does not become true, then will print the output as "it is not a Palindrome Number".
